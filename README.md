# Task2Morph
Optimizing the morphologies and the controllers that adapt to various tasks is a critical issue in the field of robot design, aka. embodied intelligence. Previous works always model it as a joint optimization problem and use searchbased methods to find the optimal solution in the morphology space. However, they ignore the implicit knowledge of task-tomorphology mapping which can directly inspire robot design. For example, flipping heavier boxes tends to require more muscular robot arms. In this paper, we propose a novel and general differentiable task-inspired framework for robot design called Task2Morph. We abstract task features highly related to task performance and use them to build a task-to-morphology mapping. Further, we embed the mapping into a differentiable robot design process, where the gradient information is leveraged for both the mapping learning and the whole optimization. The experiments are conducted on three scenarios, and the results validate that Task2Morph outperforms DiffHand in efficiency and efficacy.
